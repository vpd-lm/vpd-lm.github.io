        <p class="is-size-5">
          Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable visual reasoning capabilities, positioning them as promising solutions for a wide range of autonomous driving (AD) tasks. Unlike traditional expert-driven AD models, which often operate as opaque black boxes, VLMs generate natural language explanations for their decisions, offering inherent interpretability. This interpretability enables explicit reasoning about driving safety and facilitates the identification of rare or high-risk scenarios that conventional systems may overlook. However, existing VLM-based frameworks often struggle with grounding and tracking specific objects over time—a limitation that undermines robust decision-making in dynamic, real-world environments.
          In this work, we introduce <em><b>VPD-LM</b></em>, an end-to-end Vision-Language Model for Autonomous Driving that addresses these challenges through object-centric, video-based visual prompts and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. <em><b>VPD-LM</b></em> processes raw camera inputs and sensor metadata to generate interpretable natural language outputs for core driving tasks, including planning, perception, and safety assessment.
          To rigorously evaluate safety reasoning, we go beyond standard nuScenes-based benchmarks by constructing a novel Driving Safety Benchmark. We extract approximately 3,000 long-tail scenarios with potential collision risks from the larger nuPlan dataset using our proposed Road Graph Occupancy Detection method. From these, 600 representative scenarios are manually labeled into three risk categories—low, medium, and high—creating a challenging and fine-grained testbed for risk-aware driving models.
          Empirical results demonstrate that <em><b>VPD-LM</b></em> achieves strong performance in motion planning and threat assessment while generalizing effectively to complex and previously unseen scenarios. Our work highlights the potential of VLM-driven reasoning to significantly enhance safety, interpretability, and robustness in next-generation autonomous driving systems.

<pre class="vlm-output"><strong>1. Scene Description</strong>
The scene depicts a clear, sunny day with excellent visibility on a residential street in what appears to be a suburban neighborhood. 
The ego vehicle is traveling on a two-lane road with yellow center dividing lines, passing through a curved section of the street. 
On both sides of the road are large, upscale houses with well-maintained properties featuring white fences, manicured lawns, and modern 
architecture. There are several parked vehicles along the curb, including a <strong>white pickup truck (object 1)</strong> on the right 
side and another <strong>white pickup truck (object 2)</strong> on the left side. The road surface shows some wear with visible cracks,
but overall it appears to be in reasonable condition. Trees line the street, and construction materials can be seen near one of the houses 
on the right side. <strong>Traffic appears light, with no moving vehicles visible ahead of the ego car.</strong>

<strong>2. Critical Objects</strong>
Object 1 — White pickup truck positioned front-right of the ego vehicle.
Object 2 — White pickup truck positioned front-left of the ego vehicle.

<strong>3. Risk Analysis</strong>
In this scenario, the ego vehicle is traveling on a residential street with moderate traffic conditions. The most significant risk factor 
is the proximity of multiple vehicles to the ego vehicle, particularly the white pickup trucks (objects 1 and 2) that are positioned to 
the front-right of the ego vehicle. These vehicles appear to be parked along the curb rather than actively participating in traffic flow.
If the ego vehicle were to make any sudden maneuvers, especially if attempting to change lanes or pass these parked vehicles, there would 
be a risk of collision. The vehicles are positioned close to each other, and any unexpected movement could create a dangerous situation. 
Additionally, the presence of parked vehicles on both sides of the road limits escape routes for the ego vehicle in case of an emergency stop.

<pre class="vlm-output"><strong>1. Scene Description</strong>
The scene depicts a clear, sunny day with excellent visibility on a residential street in what appears to be <strong>San&nbsp;Francisco</strong>,
characterized by its distinctive architecture. The ego vehicle is traveling on a two‑lane road with a yellow centerline dividing opposing 
traffic directions. The surrounding environment features multi‑story apartment buildings, single‑family homes, and commercial establishments.
Power lines run overhead along both sides of the street, and there are pedestrian crosswalks visible at an intersection ahead. The road surface
shows some wear with visible cracks, but overall appears to be in reasonable condition. The area has <strong>moderate traffic</strong> with 
several vehicles parked along the curb and a few moving vehicles visible in the distance. Trees lining the street and varied housing structures 
underscore the residential nature of the neighborhood.

<strong>2. Critical Objects</strong>
Object 1: this is a dark‑colored <strong>SUV/crossover</strong> vehicle positioned to the front‑right of the ego vehicle.
Object 2: this is a silver/gray <strong>sedan</strong> positioned further ahead and slightly to the right of the ego vehicle.
Object 3: this is a <strong>dark‑colored sedan/pickup truck</strong> parked on the left side of the road near a crosswalk.
Object 4: this appears to be a <strong>pedestrian crossing sign</strong> located near the crosswalk area on the left side of the road.

<strong>3. Risk Analysis</strong>
In this scenario, the ego vehicle is traveling on a two‑lane road approaching an intersection where it will likely need to stop for pedestrians 
crossing. The most critical objects are the <strong>dark SUV (object 1)</strong> directly ahead of the ego vehicle and the <strong>silver sedan (object 2)</strong> 
positioned to the right of the ego vehicle.

The dark SUV (object 1) presents no immediate conflict since it is positioned ahead of the ego vehicle and appears to be maintaining its lane. 
However, the silver sedan (object 2) could potentially enter the ego vehicle's path if making a right turn or changing lanes, creating a 
possible conflict that requires caution. The ego vehicle should maintain its current lane and slow down as it approaches the intersection, 
preparing to stop for pedestrians. Close monitoring of object 2’s intentions  is essential, while object 1 poses no immediate threat if it 
continues forward in its lane.

<pre class="vlm-output"><strong>1. Scene Description</strong>
the scene depicts an urban intersection during what appears to be early evening or late afternoon, as evidenced by the dim lighting conditions. 
the ego vehicle is positioned at a traffic light-controlled intersection with clear lane markings visible on the road surface. directly ahead 
is a pedestrian crosswalk with white stripes. to the left side of the frame stands a large brick apartment building with multiple balconies, 
while the right side features a modern glass office building with a garage entrance. traffic signals are visible overhead, showing amber lights 
indicating caution. the surrounding environment includes landscaped areas with trees lining both sides of the street, and there are some commercial
establishments visible along the sidewalks. the overall setting suggests a downtown or commercial district area with moderate traffic flow.

<strong>2. Critical Objects</strong>
object 1: this appears to be a dark-colored vehicle positioned in the center-right portion of the frame, likely traveling in the same direction as the ego vehicle but in a different lane.  
object 4: this is a parked vehicle located on the right side of the frame near the curb, possibly in a designated parking area adjacent to the roadway.  
object 5: this appears to be a person or figure positioned near the traffic signal pole on the left side of the frame.  
object 7: this is another person or figure positioned near the traffic signal pole on the right side of the frame.

<strong>3. Risk Analysis</strong>
in analyzing the potential for behavioral conflict between the ego vehicle and any other agents in this scene, several factors must be considered:

the ego vehicle is approaching an intersection where traffic signals are active, suggesting it should slow down and prepare to stop if the 
light turns red. object 1 appears to be traveling in the same general direction as the ego vehicle but may be in a different lane. given that the 
ego vehicle is approaching a potentially busy intersection with traffic signals, maintaining a safe following distance from object 1 would be prudent.
however, since they appear to be in separate lanes, direct interaction is unlikely unless the ego vehicle changes lanes.

object 4 is parked on the right side of the road, not directly in the ego vehicle's path. this vehicle presents no immediate conflict as long as 
the ego vehicle maintains its current lane and follows proper traffic signals.

object 5 and object 7 are pedestrians positioned near the traffic signal poles. these individuals are likely to remain stationary or move slowly in 
their respective areas, posing minimal risk to the ego vehicle as long as the vehicle continues forward at a safe speed.

the scene depicts a bright, sunny day with clear blue skies and scattered clouds. the ego vehicle is traveling on a two-lane road with yellow center 
lines, passing through what appears to be a commercial area with multi-story buildings on both sides. there are several vehicles visible ahead of 
the ego car, including a white sedan directly in front and a dark-colored sedan to its right. to the left side of the road, there is a fenced parking 
lot with numerous parked vehicles, while the right side features a landscaped area with trees and shrubs. a shopping cart with a person pushing it 
can be seen near the curb on the right side. overall, the environment suggests a mixed residential-retail district with <strong>moderate traffic flow</strong>.

<strong>2. Critical Objects</strong>
object 6: a <strong>cyclist</strong> positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle.  
object 3: a <strong>white sedan</strong> positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle.  
object 4: a <strong>dark sedan</strong> positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle.  
object 5: a <strong>white sedan</strong> positioned to the front-left of the ego vehicle.  

<strong>3. Risk Analysis</strong>
the ego vehicle proceeds along a straight roadway with moderate traffic. the primary hazard is the <strong>cyclist (object 6)</strong> travelling 
near the curb to the front-right. any sudden speed change or lane shift by the ego vehicle could endanger the cyclist, who has little room to maneuver.  
the <strong>white sedan (object 3)</strong> ahead-right also poses a potential conflict if the ego vehicle intends to merge into that lane. 
maintaining a safe distance and signaling intentions early are essential. stationary elements (objects 4, 5, 11) and pedestrians (objects 7–10) do 
not currently intrude into the ego lane, but vigilance is required should any pedestrian step onto the roadway or if object 11 begins to exit the parking lot.

object 10: this appears to be another <strong>vehicle</strong> positioned further ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane. it is likely slightly 
ahead of object 8.  
object 9: this is a <strong>blue sedan</strong> directly in front of the ego vehicle, occupying the same lane and positioned slightly to the right 
of the ego vehicle’s path.

<strong>3. Risk Analysis</strong>
In this scenario, the ego vehicle is traveling on a two-lane street with moderate traffic. the <strong>black sedan (object 8)</strong> is directly 
ahead in the same lane, while the <strong>blue sedan (object 9)</strong> is also directly in front of the ego vehicle. the presence of multiple vehicles
ahead creates the potential for unexpected maneuvers. If the blue sedan were to brake suddenly, it could create a hazard for the ego vehicle. 
Similarly, if the black sedan accelerates or changes lanes, it would also pose a risk. Although a white van (object 2) is visible in the right lane, 
it does not currently interact with the ego vehicle’s path.

<pre class="vlm-output"><strong>1. Scene Description</strong>
The scene depicts an <strong>urban nighttime driving scenario</strong> in what appears to be a city center with moderate traffic conditions. 
the ego vehicle is traveling on a narrow road flanked by tall buildings on both sides. on the <strong>left side</strong>, there's a large 
construction area with scaffolding and illuminated orange traffic cones, while the <strong>right side</strong> features a multi-story building 
with a metal fence separating it from the roadway. the road surface shows some wear with visible cracks, and there are several vehicles ahead 
of the ego car. the lighting is primarily from street lamps and building lights, creating a somewhat dim environment with noticeable bokeh 
effects from the camera lens. <strong>traffic appears to be moving at a moderate pace</strong> through this urban corridor.

<strong>2. Critical Objects</strong>
object&nbsp;1: <strong>white pickup truck</strong> positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle.  
object&nbsp;2: <strong>red sedan</strong> positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle.  
object&nbsp;3: <strong>dark-colored sedan</strong> positioned directly ahead of the ego vehicle.  
object&nbsp;4: <strong>white sedan</strong> positioned slightly to the right of the ego vehicle.  
object&nbsp;5: <strong>dark-colored sedan</strong> positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle.  
object&nbsp;6: <strong>orange traffic cone</strong> near the construction area on the left side.  
object&nbsp;7: another <strong>orange traffic cone</strong> near the construction area on the left side.

<strong>3. Risk Analysis</strong>
The ego vehicle appears to be traveling on a narrow urban road with moderate traffic density. the <strong>white pickup truck (object 1)</strong> 
and <strong>red sedan (object 2)</strong> are positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle, while the <strong>dark sedan (object 3)</strong> 
is directly ahead. the traffic flow seems relatively smooth with vehicles maintaining their lanes.  

the primary concern here is the spatial proximity between the ego vehicle and the vehicles ahead. the ego vehicle is following a dark sedan that
appears to be maintaining its lane position. the white pickup truck and red sedan are positioned to the right of the ego vehicle but do not appear 
to be directly influencing the ego vehicle's path. the traffic ahead is flowing steadily, and there doesn't seem to be any immediate need for 
lane changes or sudden maneuvers.

the scene depicts an urban street intersection during daytime with overcast weather conditions. the ego vehicle is positioned at what appears 
to be a crosswalk area in a downtown commercial district. the surrounding environment features multi-story buildings with retail storefronts, 
including a distinctive blue building with mural artwork on the left side. traffic signals are visible ahead, showing green lights. there are 
several pedestrians visible on both sidewalks, some crossing the street. the road surface shows clear lane markings, and the intersection appears
to have moderate traffic flow. orange construction barriers are visible on the right side of the frame, suggesting ongoing work in that area.
the overall setting suggests a busy city center with typical urban infrastructure elements like crosswalks, traffic signals, and pedestrian walkways.

<strong>2. critical objects</strong>
object 1: this appears to be a vehicle directly ahead of the ego vehicle, likely traveling in the same direction through the intersection.  
object 5: this is a red sedan positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle, appearing to be preparing to turn right at the intersection.  
object 2: this appears to be a person or pedestrian located on the left side of the frame near the crosswalk area.

<strong>3. risk analysis</strong>
in analyzing the potential for conflict between the ego vehicle and other agents, we need to consider the spatial proximity and intended trajectories 
of all relevant entities:  

the ego vehicle is positioned behind object 1, which is directly ahead in the same lane. if object 1 continues forward while the ego vehicle
accelerates, there could be a rear-end collision risk. however, since object 1 appears to be maintaining its position in the lane ahead, this risk is minimal.  

object 5 (red sedan) is positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle. this vehicle appears to be preparing to make a right turn at the intersection.
given its position and trajectory, it will likely move into the right lane while the ego vehicle remains in its current lane. this creates a potential
conflict if the ego vehicle attempts to change lanes or accelerate while object 55 is executing its right turn maneuver.  

object 2 (pedestrian) is positioned on the left side of the frame near the crosswalk area. this pedestrian may potentially enter the roadway from the sidewalk, 
creating a risk of collision if they suddenly step into the path of the ego vehicle. however, the pedestrian appears to be stationary in this frame, 
so immediate risk is low.

distinctive <strong>purple building</strong> with a tall tower structure, while the right side features a beige mixed-use building with commercial
storefronts. traffic appears moderate, with several vehicles visible ahead and parked along both sides of the street. traffic signals at the intersection 
ahead are showing <strong>green lights</strong> for the ego vehicle’s direction.

<strong>2. critical objects</strong>

object 3 — a <strong>white minivan/SUV</strong> directly ahead in the ego vehicle’s lane.  
object 4 — a <strong>motorcycle with rider</strong> front-right of the ego vehicle, partially visible.

<strong>3. risk analysis</strong>
In analyzing the potential conflict between the ego vehicle and these objects, we need to consider their trajectories and spatial proximity:

object 2 (dark sedan) - this vehicle is positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle and appears to be traveling in its own lane. there is 
no immediate conflict as they are in separate lanes with adequate spacing. however, if object 2 changes lanes to the left, it could create a 
conflict path with the ego vehicle.

object 3 (white minivan/suv) - this vehicle is directly ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane. if the ego vehicle accelerates or makes a 
sudden lane change, it could potentially collide with this vehicle. additionally, if object 3 decelerates or stops suddenly, it would force 
the ego vehicle to react quickly.

object 4 (motorcycle) - this vehicle is positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle but appears to be moving away from the ego vehicle's
path rather than creating a conflict.

<pre class="vlm-output"><strong>1. Scene Description</strong>
The scene depicts an urban environment under a large concrete overpass structure with multiple lanes of traffic flowing beneath it. 
The weather appears to be clear with good visibility. The ego vehicle is positioned at what seems to be a major intersection, with traffic 
signals visible ahead. The road consists of several lanes with lane markings clearly visible. There are various vehicles present, including 
a <strong>delivery truck (object 4)</strong> on the right side of the road and a <strong>white sedan (object 5)</strong> on the left side. 
The surrounding area features commercial buildings, trees, and pedestrian crosswalks. Traffic appears moderate with vehicles moving in 
different directions, and the overall environment suggests this is a busy city street with multiple intersections and traffic control 
measures in place.

<strong>2. Critical Objects</strong>
<strong>Object 4</strong>: a delivery truck positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle.  
<strong>Object 5</strong>: a white sedan positioned to the front-left of the ego vehicle.  
<strong>Object 1</strong>: a vehicle positioned directly in front of the ego vehicle.  
<strong>Object 7</strong>: a no-right-turn sign mounted on a pole to the front-left of the ego vehicle.  
<strong>Object 10</strong>: a no-right-turn sign positioned to the front-right of the ego vehicle.

<strong>3. Risk Analysis</strong>
In this scenario, the ego vehicle appears to be approaching an intersection under an overpass where traffic signals are visible. 
The most critical objects are the <strong>delivery truck (object 4)</strong> and the <strong>white sedan (object 5)</strong>, both positioned 
in adjacent lanes to the ego vehicle.

If the ego vehicle plans to proceed through the intersection while maintaining its current lane, there is minimal conflict with these objects. 
The delivery truck (object 4) is positioned to the front-right and appears to be traveling in its own lane, likely preparing to make a right turn. 
Similarly, the white sedan (object 5) is positioned to the front-left and appears to be traveling in its own lane. Neither vehicle presents an 
immediate threat to the ego vehicle’s path if it continues forward.

However, if the ego vehicle plans to change lanes or make a turn, there could be potential conflicts with these vehicles. For example, if the ego 
vehicle attempts to change to the right lane, it would need to navigate around the delivery truck (object 4) which is positioned in that lane. 
Similarly, if the ego vehicle intends to make a left turn, it would need to pass the white sedan (object 5) which is positioned in the left lane.

the scene depicts a residential neighborhood during daytime with overcast weather conditions. the ego vehicle is traveling on a two-lane
road flanked by single-family homes with various architectural styles. on both sides of the street, there are parked vehicles along the curbside, 
including a black suv (object 2) on the left side and a dark-colored sedan (object 1) on the right side. the environment features typical 
suburban elements: wooden fences, palm trees, utility poles with overhead wires, and landscaped areas with trees and shrubs. the road appears to 
be in good condition with visible lane markings, though it shows some wet patches suggesting recent rain. the overall setting is quiet and 
residential with no visible pedestrians or active traffic.


<strong>2. Critical Objects</strong>
Object 1 — Dark-colored <strong>sedan</strong> parked on the right.  
Object 2 — Black <strong>SUV</strong> parked on the left.  
Object 3 — <strong>Pedestrian</strong> standing on the sidewalk near object 2.  
Object 5 — <strong>Basketball hoop</strong> overhanging the right curb above parked vehicles.

<strong>3. Risk Analysis</strong>
in this scenario, the ego vehicle is traveling on a residential street with parked vehicles on both sides. the most critical objects are 
the black suv (object 2) on the left and the dark-colored sedan (object 1) on the right. 

the ego vehicle has sufficient space to continue forward without immediate conflict with either vehicle. the black suv (object 2) is parked 
on the left side and appears to be stationary. similarly, the dark-colored sedan (object 1) is parked on the right side and also appears 
to be stationary. there is adequate lateral separation between these vehicles and the ego vehicle's path.

however, there is a pedestrian (object 3) visible near the parked black suv on the right side. while this person appears to be standing still, 
their proximity to the parked vehicles creates a potential hazard if they were to suddenly enter the roadway. the ego vehicle should maintain
awareness of this pedestrian and proceed with caution.

The scene depicts an urban street environment during daytime with clear weather conditions. The ego vehicle is traveling on a wide 
multi-lane road flanked by tall office buildings on both sides. The road has clearly marked yellow crosswalks and lane dividers. 
Traffic signals are visible at an upcoming intersection, showing green lights for the ego vehicle's direction. There are several pedestrians 
visible on the sidewalks, including cyclists and individuals walking near the crosswalk area. The urban setting features well-maintained
trees lining the streets and modern commercial buildings, creating a typical downtown or business district atmosphere.

<strong>2. Critical Objects</strong>

Object 6 — Cyclist positioned to the right of the ego vehicle, likely preparing to cross the street.  
Object 7 — Another cyclist positioned farther to the right of the ego vehicle, also potentially preparing to cross.

<strong>3. Risk Analysis</strong>
in this scenario, the ego vehicle is approaching an intersection where it will need to stop at a red light. the critical objects are 
the pedestrians/cyclists who may be crossing the street. 

object 5 is positioned to the front-left of the ego vehicle and appears to be actively crossing the street. if the ego vehicle continues 
forward, there would be a direct path of collision with this pedestrian. additionally, object 6 and object 7 are cyclists positioned to 
the right of the ego vehicle, likely preparing to cross the street. if the ego vehicle stops suddenly at the intersection, these cyclists 
might have limited time to react and could potentially collide with the ego vehicle if they attempt to enter the intersection while the light is red.
