3. risk analysis
in this scenario, the ego vehicle is traveling on a two-lane road approaching an intersection where it will likely need to stop for pedestrians crossing. the most critical objects are the dark suv (object 1) directly in front of the ego vehicle and the silver sedan (object 2) positioned to the right of the ego vehicle.

the dark suv (object 1) presents no immediate conflict since it is positioned ahead of the ego vehicle and appears to be maintaining its lane. however, the silver sedan (object 2) is positioned to the right of the ego vehicle and could potentially enter the ego vehicle's path if making a right turn or changing lanes. this creates a potential conflict situation that requires caution from the ego vehicle.

the ego vehicle should maintain its current lane and slow down as it approaches the intersection, preparing to stop for pedestrians. the silver sedan (object 2) may need to make a right turn or change lanes, which would require the ego vehicle to be aware of its intentions and adjust speed accordingly. the dark suv (object 1) poses no immediate threat as long as it continues forward in its lane.

risk level: unsafe
