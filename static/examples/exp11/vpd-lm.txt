1. scene description
the scene depicts an urban street environment during daytime with clear weather conditions. the ego vehicle is traveling on a wide multi-lane road flanked by tall office buildings on both sides. the road has clearly marked yellow crosswalks and lane dividers. traffic signals are visible at an upcoming intersection, showing green lights for the ego vehicle's direction. there are several pedestrians visible on the sidewalks, including cyclists and individuals walking near the crosswalk area. the urban setting features well-maintained trees lining the streets and modern commercial buildings creating a typical downtown or business district atmosphere.

2. critical objects
object 1: this appears to be a white sedan positioned directly ahead of the ego vehicle in the same lane.
object 5: this is a person on foot positioned to the left side of the ego vehicle, likely crossing the street.
object 6: this appears to be a cyclist positioned to the right of the ego vehicle, likely preparing to cross the street.
object 7: another cyclist positioned further to the right of the ego vehicle, also potentially preparing to cross.

3. risk analysis
in this scenario, the ego vehicle is approaching an intersection where it will need to stop at a red light. the critical objects are the pedestrians/cyclists who may be crossing the street. 

object 5 is positioned to the front-left of the ego vehicle and appears to be actively crossing the street. if the ego vehicle continues forward, there would be a direct path of collision with this pedestrian. additionally, object 6 and object 7 are cyclists positioned to the right of the ego vehicle, likely preparing to cross the street. if the ego vehicle stops suddenly at the intersection, these cyclists might have limited time to react and could potentially collide with the ego vehicle if they attempt to enter the intersection while the light is red.

risk level: unsafe
